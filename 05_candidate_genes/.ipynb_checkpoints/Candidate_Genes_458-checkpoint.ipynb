    "Mutation is the ultimate source of complex trait variation and plays a central role in driving evolution. While variation introduced by mutation increases genetic variation in a population, other evolutionary forces also affect the total genetic variation$.^{7}$ Genetic drift can shuffle genetic variation or reduce it due to random chance, while natural selection can decrease variation by favoring traits (and their underlying mutations) that are beneficial to individuals$.^{11}$ Observing how much variation is retained in a population can thus help to explore the effect of mutation on complex traits. Populations of natural isolate (NI) strains and mutation accumulation (MA) strains serve as complementary models for investigating this variation: NI strains have different genetic backgrounds and undergo mutation under natural selection, while MA strains start with an identical genetic background and undergo mutation under minimal selection$.^{7}$ By comparing these two populations, we can parse the role of selection in shaping trait variation, concurrently examining how mutation alone influences trait variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore the effect of mutation on complex traits, phototaxis in the model organism *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii* (*C. reinhardtii*) was studied. Phototaxis describes the ability to move in response to a light stimulus, which in *C. reinhardtii* is driven by two motile flagella and a sensory eyespot organelle. Phototaxis is important in optimizing light absorption for photosynthesis$.^{12}$ A protocol was developed to quantify this trait in NI and MA strains. Much of the research on phototaxis in *C. reinhardtii* has focused on the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate flagellar movement$,^{3,9,14}$ along with modelling the cells' movement$.^{1,6}$ While some genes contributing to flagellar function and sensory mechanisms are known (eg. SHF1, FAP2, TTLL9)$,^{5}$ how mutations in these genes affect the overall phototaxis phenotype, particularly in the context of genetic variation within different *C. reinhardtii* strains, is not yet fully understood. The lack of experimental validation of candidate genes, particularly within a broad range of strains, leaves a significant gap in our understanding of phototaxis. This is important to explore, as there is conservation of proteins across *Chlamydomonas* and human cilia, which has previously been exploited to isolate human genes related to ciliary dysfunctions$.^{8}$\n",
    "\n",
    "From an evolutionary perspective, the question was thus: what is the correlation between the phototaxis phenotype and the number of mutations in MA strains that fall within candidate phototaxis genes? This allows determination of the average effect of hit mutations on phototaxis (ie. if mutations tend to increase or decrease phototaxis). An exploratory analysis of candidate genes can also be performed. The nature of the questions depends on which direction the data points, but ultimately, may highlight genes of relevance in a future variant mapping experiment, using recombination to map effects of mutations on phototaxis. Possibilities include tracking candidate genes with the most hit mutations, checking for trends in the same hit candidate genes across strains with extreme phenotypes, and examining whether certain organelles or processes having a stronger effect on phototaxis through annotation information."

    "For this analysis, several files are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The C. reinhardtii CC-4532 v6.1 genome assembly and annotation was downloaded from Phytozome. This folder contains several files of relevance. Note that some files have transcriptName instead of geneName, in which case the gene that each transcript belongs to can easily be determined by taking the root of the name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"CreinhardtiiCC_4532_707_v6.1.annotation_info\" is a tab-delimited file summarizing annotation details from Phytozome. Relevant columns include the Phytozome gene locus name (used to denote genes), the transcript name (used to denote transcripts), the GO column (which lists Gene Ontology terms associated with each gene, representing predicted biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions), and the Best-hit-clamy-defline (which contains the top BLASTP alignment result when each protein in this proteome is aligned back against a previous Chlamydomonas reference proteome). The latter two columns can be used to filter candidate genes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"CreinhardtiiCC_4532_707_v6.1.description.txt\" is a tab-delimited file with functional descriptions of all predicted transcripts in the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii CC-4532 v6.1 genome. The first column contains the transcript IDs (e.g., Cre01.g000050_4532.1), and the second column provides brief descriptions based on predicted domains, homology to known proteins, or gene family annotations. These descriptions are useful for interpreting gene function and prioritizing candidates based on known or inferred biological roles. The latter column can be used to filter candidate genes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"CreinhardtiiCC_4532_707_v6.1.geneName.txt\" is a tab-delimited file with gene name annotations for each transcript in the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii CC-4532 v6.1 genome. The first column lists the transcript IDs (e.g., Cre01.g000050_4532.1), and the second column provides the corresponding gene or protein name (e.g., RWP-RK domain transcription factor). These names are useful for mapping transcripts to common gene identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"CreinhardtiiCC_4532_707_v6.1.gene.gff3.gz\" contains gene annotation data in GFF3 format, including genomic coordinates for features such as genes, mRNAs, UTRs, and CDS. This file is useful for mapping mutations to specific genomic regions of the CC-4532 v6.1 reference genome.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The \"Mutation_Location.txt\" tab-delimited file, generated by Rob Ness and Eniolaye Balogun, contains mutation data from multiple MA strains, including those used in this study. It includes genomic coordinates, functional annotations (e.g., synonymous, nonsynonymous mutations), gene feature overlaps, and quality metrics for each mutation. This file can be used to check mutations against candidate genes to generate hits across strains.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The \"fitness+mut+pheno.csv\" file integrates three types of information for each MA line: relative fitness compared to its ancestor, the total number of mutations accumulated during the MA experiment, and phototaxis phenotype. The main phenotypic metric, scaled_mean_max, reflects the average of the maximum distance travelled by a strain across multiple protocol iterations, scaled by its ancestor's value (MA / ANC). The fitness and mutation count were generated through previous Ness lab experiments, and the data was provided by Eniolaye Balogun. The phenotypic information was generated from the protocol quantifying phototaxis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The \"Phototaxis_Candidiate_Genes.xlsx\" file lists 247 genes identified through GO term searches on the Gene Ontology Resource using keywords such as \"cilia,\" \"movement,\" \"motility,\" \"locomotion,\" \"eyespot,\" and \"flagella.\" Genes with common names in the \"Gene/product (bioentity_label)\" column can be linked to formal Phytozome gene identifiers by merging with the geneName.txt file, which maps common names to transcript IDs. The file can therefore be used to filter candidate genes."

    "The correlation between the scaled mean maximum distance and the total number of candidate gene mutations was weak and the OLS regression was not statistically significant (r = -0.103, p = 0.609). The results were similar for synonymous mutations (r = 0.086, p = 0.671). This suggests that while mutations in candidate genes might influence phototaxis, they do not appear to have a strong directional effect. This supports unpublished results generated in the Ness lab for the phototaxis phenotype data. The variation in phototaxis of each MA group was much greater than the variation seen in the respective ancestor, reaching a similar degree as the NI group. This means that strains tend to get faster as much as they get slower, and faster is not always beneficial (likely due to some tradeoff).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "An interesting but isolated observation is that a strain with an extreme phenotype had a synonymous mutation in a candidate gene: CC-2344 L10 (rank = 3). Some strains with extreme phototaxis phenotypes, such as CC-2344 L4 (1 mutation), did not exhibit a large number of hit mutations. Meanwhile, CC-2931 L9, despite having a relatively large number of hit mutations (5), did not exhibit an extreme phenotype. These inconsistencies may suggest that other factors, such as gene interactions or additional unknown genes, might be influencing the phototaxis phenotype.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Another finding was that mutations in flagella-related genes were the most common across strains. The common names of the most mutated genes were FAP51, LF3, FAP343, FAP376, FBB19, FAP221, and FAP184 based on **Table 6** (FAP = flagellar-associated protein , LF = long-flagella, FBB = flagella basal body). This is consistent with previous work on *C. reinhardtii*, where flagella-related genes are often implicated in motility, but a holistic overview of their role in phototaxis is still under investigation. A study of LF3 showed that mutants had defective flagellar assembly and length regulation$.^{10}$ A different study using axonemal extracts identified FAP221 as part of a calcium-dependent complex that regulates flagella motility by interacting with calmodulin in high calcium concentrations$.^{4}$ FAP genes generally play key roles involved in the assembly and function of the axoneme in eukaryotic flagella, but the remaining FAP genes have not been experimentally validated$.^{2}$ Generally, FBB genes have been shown to lead to short cilia and a loss of dynein arms, indicating a role in flagellar function$.^{13}$\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Explanations for the lack of significant findings could be the sample size, along with the fact that candidate genes were assembled using BLAST and GO annotations instead of strictly literature-based genes. Only 440 candidate genes had proper coordinate annotation information. From these, only 30 genes did not harbour any NaN values; these rows may represent candidate genes with more confidence, as they were annotated from all three data sources. Regardless, the sample size and selection methodology may not be representative of the full genetic diversity of *C. reinhardtii* and might explain the lack of hit synonymous mutations. Experimental variant mapping data can help ascertain which candidate genes truly contribute to photoaxis.\r\n"
