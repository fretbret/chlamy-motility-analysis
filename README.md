# Chlamy Motility Analysis
This repository contains the Jupyter notebook and supporting files for a quantitative and evolutionary analysis of motility and phototaxis in *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii*.  
The work explores differences across mutation accumulation (MA) and natural isolate (NI) strains, integrating biological context with statistical and computational analysis.

## Repository structure
- **notebooks/** – contains the main analysis notebook (`MotA_Real_Analysis.ipynb`)
- **scripts/** – (optional) folder for future standalone analysis or plotting scripts
- **example_data/** – (optional) placeholder for small demo datasets
- **figures/** – (optional) folder for generated plots
- **requirements.txt** – Python package dependencies

## Analysis overview
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Visualization of motility trajectories and weekly averages  
3. Statistical difference testing between strains and types (parametric & non-parametric)  
4. Evolutionary statistics linking phototaxis to fitness and mutational variance  

## Tools & environment
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy)
- R (tidyverse, ggplot2)
- JupyterLab

## Reproducibility
To view the analysis:
1. Clone this repository  
2. Open `notebooks/MotA_Real_Analysis.ipynb` in JupyterLab  
3. Follow the notebook from top to bottom
